INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP MAC APP TO LAUNCH SERVICE MANAGER
===============

1. Drag the app within this folder to Automator app.
2. When Automator launches, you will need to change the address. Point this to the address where you store your server. Currently, it is set to http://localhost:8888/ which is what my MAMP is using.
3. Test it by clicking run (top right).
4. Click File > Export and save where you wish.
